To install shiny server on a linux server enter the following commands into the commandline:
sudo su - \
-c "R -e \"install.packages('shiny', repos='https://cran.rstudio.com/')\""
sudo apt install gdebi-core
wget https://download3.rstudio.org/ubuntu-12.04/x86_64/shiny-server-1.5.6.875-amd64.deb
sudo gdebi shiny-server-1.5.6.875-amd64.deb

Address: 10.117.202.30:4949/website/
This is what to type into the address bar in a web browser to access the website.

Configuration file: etc/shiny-server/shiny-server.conf
This file defines where the file for the website is located, what port to listen on, and where to save the log files.
For the changes to take effect you must restart the server by entering the following into the commandline on the server:
sudo systemctl restart shiny-server

Make sure the folder(s) you are reading/writing to are owned by shiny or else shiny won't have permission to do anything:
sudo chown shiny:shiny /full/path/to/directory

The following line of code will delete all files in the results folder that are at least 1 day old:
find /home/test/PycharmProjects/landSuitabilityRatingSystem/landSuitabilityRatingSystem/dataFiles/test_data/results -mtime +1 -delete
All scripts in the /etc/cron.daily will be run every day, so I put the above line of code in a file called "lsrs" in that folder
Another way is to type crontab -e into the terminal and enter the following line of code:
1 0 * * * find /home/test/PycharmProjects/landSuitabilityRatingSystem/landSuitabilityRatingSystem/dataFiles/test_data/results -mtime +1 -delete
